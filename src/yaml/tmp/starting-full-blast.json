  "content": "# Starting Full Blast\nAfter a short first meeting of the Coding the Humanities crew on Monday evening in the home-from-home in the pilot space, the actual programme started full blast on Tuesday morning. \n\nAs a short warm up, the students divided into small groups to briefly discuss their favourite websites. One would talk about their site, while the others would note down keywords, an image associated with the story and a slogan. After this, the students translated these stories into a HTML format and added CSS styling. At the end of the day, they presented their results.\n\n## The First Projects\nOn Wednesday morning, the group began the day with a \"stand up\"; in three groups they discussed how they had experienced the first day, was it tough, did they learn much, what issues did they run in to? The assignment for the morning consisted of working on developing webpages, in mock-up, related to three humanities’ themes or topics: \"Power in the museum\", \"Identity and the selfie\" en \"Rhythms as a tool”. \n\nWorking collaboratively, they developed posters, which were presented to the larger group. After the break, each group actually developed the ideas on their posters by creating a page, after which – using github, the pages were shared, so that each could work on the page of another group. The day ended with a lecture about webcomponents.\n\n###What is Data in the Humanities?\nAfter the stand up on Thursday morning, guest speaker Jan Willem Tulp of [Tulp Interactive](http://tulpinteractive.com/) gave a lecture about data visualisation, after which the students worked on the question on what data is in the different humanities; what would you consider to be data, how would you problematize data and how would you be able to translate this into a webcomponent? \n\nUsing an actual project, paper or idea as a starting point, ideas were sketched on posters. The ideas of the students were very diverse; finding a common ground to discuss \"data\", and translating this into a visualization resulted in three designs.\n\n## The First Presentations\nThe day ended with an open event, where visitors and students could listen to short presentations by the Coding the Humanities team, the poster presentations of the students and share a drink and pizza.\n"
