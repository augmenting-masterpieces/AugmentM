  "content": "# Project House Mouse\nCoding the Humanities is proud to present their pilot group and their project \"House Mouse\". Despite soaring temperatures and the ongoing World Cup, the group was present every day from early in the morning to late at night and not without result! Without further ado, we give the floor to the class of June, 2014.   \n\n## From Pizza to Polymer\nWe are a group of students from diverse disciplines within the UvA humanities, who came together in the early days of june to follow the pilot [Coding the Humanities](/). Most of us were absolute beginners. A few had some very basic coding skills. Four weeks later, after loads of coffee, conceptualising, frustration, collaboration, pizzas, drinks, polymer elements, javascript workshops, presentations, grunt workshops, pitches, posters (the list could go on and on), the resulting [website](housemouse.codingthehumanities.com) is now our precious project.\n\n## What Does House Mean to You?\nOur main project, called Project House Mouse, is a website that evolves around a typical humanities question: What does house mean to you? Although you may not be aware of it, each one of us has a different connotation to a basic concept like this. It's a seemingly simple question, yet it turns out to be complex to give a simple answer. \n\nOn our [website](housemouse.codingthehumanities.com) the user is asked to answer this question by choosing one of the three images each representing a different type of house. The next step is to choose three images out of six that each represent an object that's closely related to the surroundings of a house. This user input is stored and integrated into the visualisation: a map of Europe that displays what type of house users from European countries chose. The website is built using [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), a new library that allows developers to write their own custom web components.  \n\nAfter this, the chosen concepts are used to perform a search in a dataset that the Dutch government has made public [openoverheid.org](openoverheid.org). The search looks for more information on these chosen concepts. A statistical table presents the choices correlated with the data from the dataset. The table shows how many working, semi working and broken links are found in the public dataset.\n\nThere's only one question left: what does house mean to you? \n\n## About the Coding the Humanities Pilot\n\nThe Coding the Humanities pilot introduced students from the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam to the world of programming. During one month, every working day, students follow an intensive course on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Experts from the industry give lectures and workshops on the basics of web development, programming, project management, and databases. The students work in groups and on collaborative projects.\n\nThe group of students comes from a variety of disciplines within the Humanities, such as Media Studies, European Studies, Philosophy and even Musicology! The goal of the project is to learn how to program in order to have more control over one's own research. Everybody starts out on different levels of coding skills, but through collaboration and pair programming, all students manage to enhance their knowledge. This project isn't just educational. It's also a lot of fun (and frustrating, but that's part of writing code).\n"
