  # Bringing Home the House Mouse
  
  What seemed to be a vast period of time has come to and end–or rather, has transitioned into a next phase.This was the last week of what will only be once: the pilot of Coding the Humanities. 

  The final week of the pilot began with a discussion with Jan Willem Tulp of Tulp Interactive and Alexandro Mancusi of Weyeser. We talked about what we as a team would want to communicate with our project: which questions do we want to ask, and what do we want to visualise? After discussing this, tasks were divided so each of the smaller groups could really get to finish and complete our project–which we named ["House Mouse"]().

  ## Long Sessions, Long Nights
  
  On Tuesday, Marijn Koolen gave a lecture about how to deal with different kinds of databases, while Jan Hein Hoogstad lectured about the JavaScript task runner [Grunt](Grunt). The last three days consisted of a lot of hard work, long nights and dinners together. While everyone worked to complete and integrate all the different parts of the project, a small part of the team also prepared a 5-minute presentation about the project. 

  On our last Thursday event, the project was proudly presented to our final expert guests, Wolfgang and Wolfgang [sic] from [CastYourArt]() in Vienna. After the presentation, we all enjoyed fresh food and drinks and discussed the next steps for our project.

  ## Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards
  
  Friday was a day of looking back on the experience of this very intensive month, both as a reflection on what's in the past as building a bridge toward what's next. The students discussed their team evaluation and decided to grade themselves per week and on several aspects–learning, coordination, collaboration, reflection, presentation and product. After a heated discussion, everyone was satisfied with the collective grade. 

  The pilot ended with a wonderful BBQ with delicious sausages and bananas filled with pistachio-chocolate. We previewed the short video made about the pilot by Anouk. This won't be the end–our future is in development. 
 
  Thank you, lab rat! You were our favourite.
