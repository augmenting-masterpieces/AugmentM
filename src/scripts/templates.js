    "	<p class=\"boldAlinea\">\"Thinking .. from the visitor’s own perspective is revealing because they have little conception of, or tolerance for, the museum’s own inability to meet their expectations.” - Seb Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media, Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "	<p>Augmenting Masterpieces applies visitor's photography through User Camera Studies (UCS)1 as one of the main research sources. In addition to other interview methods they give not only room to individual oral, but also to visual stories and analysis which supports the project's targeted innovation process for multi-medial and digital interfaces for museums. \n" +

    "\n" +
    "	<p>The UCS helped to understand the social dimensions of a museum and map the museum experience as the participating visitors moved social aspects and rather basic preconditions for art reception back into the center of attention by addressing their interaction with the space, museum staff, other visitors and art objects. </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "	<p>This exemplary case study shows how the User Camera Studies were conducted,  givesphotographic examples and types of insights museums can gain by using photographic means as a source of feedback from their visitors.</p>\n" +

    "	<p>The purpose of our study was to get actionable feedback and qualitative input from the visitors for developing digital devices or interaction in the Rijksmuseum. The User Camera Study consists of two phases. First the participants are given a camera with which they walk through the museum and take pictures of whatever draws their attention. They can choose themselves what they capture, for how long they want to stay in the exhibition and how many pictures they want to take.</p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "	<p>The second phase is a qualitative interview in which they first get to talk about the photographs in a way that is comparable to someone showing their vacation pictures: descriptive and as detailed as they prefer. Later on specific questions concerning sensual experiences (what did you hear, smell, touch?) and digital devices (which devices did you use during your visit and to do what?) </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "	<p>This setting gives the participants freedom to talk about their own points of interest and observations during their visit in a vacation-style narrative that is familiar to most people. The pictures that the participants take also serve to remember certain situations and aspects easily. As the study provides oral and visual feedback, it reveals different kinds of information than a thematically focused survery. </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "	<p>The survey had twelve participants from four out of the five visitors' categories the Rijksmuseum works with on a daily basis in their education and marketing department. These four categories all concern unaccompanied visitors (Cultural Tourist, Art Lover's, Cultural Professionals and Families, whereas the fifth category consists of accompanied groups (school classes and workshop groups from the Teekenschool).</p>\n" +
    "	<p>Three Cultural Tourists, three Art Lover's, two Cultural Professionals and one Family (with three children, who each participated as well) participated in the present survey. Below there is one detailed profile and script from a participating Cultural Tourist in order to get an indepth view on the kind of feedback provided.The most revealing result of the survey were that the social dimensions of a visit to the Rijksmuseum are highly important for all visitor's types. Whereas the amount of time spent on looking at art works and written information varied largely, all participants observed other visitors, listened into their conversations or were wondering about their own – proper - behaviour at times. </p>\n" +

    "			<h4>Interdisciplinary Approach (method)</h4>\n" +
    "			<p>Embedded research projects who stimulate collaborations between the creative industries and university research enable new forms of research. As do Artistic Research, Design Thinking and Digital Humanities. Each of them is a rather new discipline of itself. In order to do justice to the new goals of not only theoretically investigate, but also practically implement research results within the same project, a new set of tools and possible forms for output are necessary. The methodological combination of the above mentioned toolboxes guarantees an adequate interdisciplinary assemblage of techniques and media. Whereas Artistic Research allows to creatively and practically work with post-modern theories, the Design Thinking approach gives access to co-creation frameworks and user innovation while building a product-oriented bridge between research and prototype. The overarching question of how digitality enters musea through which technology nowadays.  </p>\n" +
    "			<h4>Embedded Research (method)</h4>\n" +
    "			<p>As embedded research project, Augmenting Masterpieces takes a close look at social aspects and focuses on visitor interaction before exploring technological enhancements and building prototypes. Through need-oriented, user centered and creative methods from both design thinking and artistic research, gaining necessary technical expertise through collaborating with private partners and carefully documenting the process, we not only present our research, but also offer support for others who might want to investigate questions around digitality in their museums or institutions.  </p>\n" +

    "			<h4>Digital Humanities (method)</h4>\n" +
    "			<p>This project approaches the collection of the Rijksmuseum primarily as data rather than artworks. This is in no way an attempt to diminish the value of the painting, but rather a shift in perspective in order to discover new ways of interacting and discovering hidden treasures in these famous artworks. This project aims at building a bridge between the practical dimensions of datavisualisation and interaction design on the one hand, and the theoretical concerns of art history and audience studies on the other. Practices of visualisation seem to be an excellent fit for the humanities.  </p>\n" +
